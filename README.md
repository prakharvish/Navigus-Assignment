# Quiz-Game
In the following assignment, we are going to build an adaptive learning platform,
leveraging gamification to engage users.

There are two types of user roles in this application:

● Teachers

● Students

A teacher is supposed to add, remove, edit, and delete courses. 
For each course, they will be able to create one quiz only, based on a set of questions and their respective
answers (Choice-based Questions only). 
Teachers should also be able to add/edit/delete questions and answers to a quiz for a course.
A quiz can contain multiple questions, and each question may have multiple correct answers. 
The teacher must set the points (positive integer with max value 10) for each question that the student must receive by answering the question correctly.
A teacher must also specify the passing points for the overall course quiz that a student must obtain. 
While taking a quiz, if a student has achieved a passing score, they can choose to continue to earn more points or leave the quiz.
